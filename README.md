# ASCII Camera

An ASCII camera is a type of camera that captures images using ASCII characters instead of pixels. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, which is a character encoding system used to represent text in computers. ASCII cameras work by converting the light and dark areas of an image into different ASCII characters. Each character represents a different shade of gray, ranging from light to dark. The resulting image would be a grid of ASCII characters, with each character representing a different shade of gray. While ASCII cameras are no longer commonly used for photography, they remain a popular tool for creating ASCII art, which is a form of digital art made entirely out of ASCII characters.
